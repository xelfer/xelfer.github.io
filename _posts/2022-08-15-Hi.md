I’ve been an AWS Community Builder since 2021. I’m also the founder of the [Wollongong AWS User Group](https://www.meetup.com/aws-wollongong/), co-founder of the [Sydney Serverless Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sydney-serverless-meetup-group/) and the beloved [AWS-powered Serverless Christmas lights](https://twitter.com/AWSCloudANZ/status/1599629849798316035) guy. I’ve created many AWS training courses and series (with over 1 million views on the [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/) platform), have assisted in the planning and operation of [ServerlessConf](https://serverlessconf.io/) (London, Austin) and [ServerlessDays](https://anz.serverlessdays.io/) (Melbourne) conferences, and am currently running @nickexplainsaws on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nickexplainsaws) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nickexplainsaws).
